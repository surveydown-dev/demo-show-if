# Database setup

# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database, update the sd_database() function with details
# from your supabase database. For this demo, we set ignore = TRUE, which will
# ignore the settings and won't attempt to connect to the database. This is
# helpful for local testing if you don't want to record testing data in the
# database table. See the documentation for details:
# https://surveydown.org/store-data

db <- sd_database(
  host   = "",
  dbname = "",
  port   = "",
  user   = "",
  table  = "",
  ignore = TRUE
)

# Server setup
server <- function(input, output, session) {

  # Define any conditional display logic here (show a question if a condition is true)
  sd_show_if(
    input$penguins_simple == "other" ~ "penguins_simple_other",
    input$penguins_complex == "other" &
      input$show_other == "show" ~ "penguins_complex_other"
  )

  # Database designation and other settings
  sd_server(
    db = db
  )

}

# shinyApp() initiates your app - don't change it
