A demo of how to implement [conditional display](https://surveydown.org/config-options#conditional-display) in a surveydown survey.

The demo showcases the `show_if()` and `show_if_custom()` functions:

1.`show_if()` is used for basic conditional display, where a question appears only if a specific response to a specific question is chosen.
2. `show_if_custom()` is used for custom conditional display, where more complex logic can be applied. Users can define any custom function to use as a condition for displaying a question.
